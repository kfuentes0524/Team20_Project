# Examples Across Sectors (Part 1)

### Healthcare Example
"Improved patient outcomes by developing a predictive model using Python and scikit-learn. Data was preprocessed using pandas to handle missing values and standardize features. Logistic regression was selected through cross-validation due to its interpretability and performance."

### Retail Example
"Optimized inventory management with SQL and Tableau. Data was cleaned and aggregated using SQL queries to identify sales patterns. Visualizations in Tableau helped to forecast demand, leading to cost savings."

*⏭️ Continued on next slide...*

---

# Examples Across Sectors (Part 2)

### Marketing Example
Increased customer engagement by performing customer segmentation using k-means clustering with Python. Feature engineering was conducted to create meaningful segments based on purchase history and demographics. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method, which helps identify the point where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model.

---

# Selecting Projects That Showcase Your Skills

Choosing the right projects for your portfolio is crucial. Each project should:

- **Solve Real Problems**: Use actual datasets to address genuine issues in your field. (*examples in the next slide*)
- **Demonstrate Industry Relevance**: Select projects that are pertinent to your specific area, such as marketing analytics for marketers or predictive maintenance for engineers.
- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Focus on projects that deliver clear, practical outcomes that demonstrate your ability to impact real-world scenarios.

These criteria ensure that your projects not only highlight your technical skills but also your understanding of and adaptability to industry-specific challenges, making you a valuable candidate to potential employers.

---

# Project Requirements

By the end of ***Project 2***:

1. Each team member must __submit one Pull Request__, including writing a proper description.

2. Each project must __design, implement, and test regression__.

3. Each team must create a __data visualization__ or __machine learning model__.

4. Each team must __create a README__ that explains the project, your team's approach, and any relevant details. Keep in mind that the repo will be on each team member's profile, so be thoughtful about the details you include here.

5. Each team member must __create a video__ about their learnings and experience.

---

# Project Requirements

***There are no requirements for the end of Project 1!***
However, you should think about the milestones you need to reach in Project 1
to set yourself up for success in Project 2.

1. Thoroughly understand your data and the business case for your analysis. What will the impact of your results be?

2. Clean your data. Be confident in the decisions you have made while doing so (eg. default handling of NULL values).

3. Test out regression analyses. It may take several tries before you are satisfied with your results and understand how you can provide the most insight. Projects are usually iterative, so dedicate time to investigation!

---

***There are no requirements for the end of Project 1!***
However, you should think about the milestones you need to reach in Project 1
to set yourself up for success in Project 2.

4. Make sure your code is well commented and decisions are documented. When Team Project 2 starts, you should be able to jump right back into your project without relying on memory.

5. Keep your README up to date. Not only is that easier than writing it all at the end of your project, it will help keep you on track and ensure your alignment with your business objective.

---

## Merge Conflicts

It is likely that you will encounter merge conflicts when combining your work as a team.
Make sure you've reviewed the Git material regarding how to resolve merge conflicts properly!

---

# Crafting a Comprehensive Main README File

- **Purpose & Overview:** Introduce the project with essential details, concise description and a project objective.
- **Goals & Objectives:** Articulate what the project aims to achieve.
- **Techniques & Technologies:** Highlight the tools and methods used.
- **Key Findings & Instructions:** Summarize outcomes and provide setup instructions.
- **Visuals & Credits:** Enhance with visuals; acknowledge contributors.

<!-- 
Focus on the essence of what makes a README effective: clarity and conciseness. A well-organized README provides a snapshot of the project, helping others quickly understand its value and how to engage with it. Ensure that each element is presented in a way that contributes to an overall understanding of the project.
-->

---

# Better Documentation - README

While **you can have multiple README files** in your repository, include only one README file per folder to keep things clean and simple. This structure showcases your ability to manage and present complex information effectively, increasing your appeal to potential employers.

---

# Better Documentation - Comments

**Effective commenting enhances code readability and maintainability, crucial for collaborative environments.**

If someone with no tech background reads your code, they should get the essence of what you are doing and how the code flows. This practice not only aids in understanding but also facilitates smoother transitions and updates within team projects.

📰 [Best practices for writing code comments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/23/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/)

## Example

❌
```
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
}

let totalPrice = calculateTotal(25, 5);
console.log(totalPrice); // Output: 125
```

✅
```
// Calculates the total cost by multiplying the price per item with the quantity
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
}

// Example usage: Calculates the total price for 5 items at $25 each by multiplying the price
// per item ($25) with the quantity (5), and stores the result in the totalPrice variable.
let totalPrice = calculateTotal(25, 5);
console.log(totalPrice); // Output: 125
```

---

# Better Documentation - STAR Method

- The STAR method is typically used for answering interview questions, and applying this structure to your project overviews can be highly effective. 
- By organizing your projects using the Situation, Task, Action, Result format, your portfolio essentially speaks for you, conducting a virtual interview with potential employers even in your absence. 
- This approach ensures that employers can clearly understand the value and impact of your work, even without direct interaction.
- Remember, the results don't have to be ground breaking, anything that showcases your abilities in data science/machine learning, even "**learning**" counts as an important result.

---

# Effective GitHub Repository Organization

- Ensure your GitHub repository is neatly organized; avoid unused or empty folders and ensure each folder has a clear purpose.
- Use READMEs in key folders (like `src`, `iac`, `backend`, `frontend`, etc.) to detail their contents and purpose, aiding clarity for complex sections.
- Avoid READMEs in simple folders (like `images`, `docs`, etc.), unless there's specific information that needs to be explained.

---

# Project Structure

* **One** person from each team must host the primary Git repository. Other team members should clone that repository to work on it.

* There is no hard requirement for the folder structure of your project, but best practices should be followed.

---

# Working as a Team

This week will fly by quickly! How will you ensure that you can accomplish everything you need to as a team in this timeframe?

---

## Working as a Team

1. **Clear objectives and milestones**. Milestones should be set working backward from the final project goal and deadline.

2. **Accountability**. Every action item should have someone assigned. (Of course, the assigned person can change if workloads become unbalanced.)

3. **Communication of roadblocks**. It is just as important to communicate roadblocks and failures as successes. The faster problems are identified, the faster they can be addressed.

---

## Working as a Team

4. **Tracking**. Tracking your tasks is necessary to objectively assess your progress as a team. The data-driven mindset applies here too! If you fall behind, update your plan accordingly. 

5. **Documentation**. Team members should be able to understand and continue each others' work where necessary.

---

# Handling Uncertainty in Your Project

Throughout your project, there will be moments when you are unsure of how to proceed, or what task to work on next. The _Orders of Ignorance_ is a concept that can help guide you in these situations.

---

## [The Five Orders of Ignorance](https://www.5oi.org/the-five-orders-of-ignorance)

**A "meta-model of ignorance" that can help us put the unknowns of projects into context.**

0. Zeroth Order Ignorance (0OI): Lack of Ignorance
1. First Order Ignorance (1OI): Lack of Knowledge
2. Second Order Ignorance (2OI): Lack of Awareness
3. Third Order Ignorance (3OI): Lack of Process
4. Fourth Order Ignorance (4OI): Meta Ignorance

---

## [The Five Orders of Ignorance](https://www.5oi.org/the-five-orders-of-ignorance)

**0. Zeroth Order Ignorance (0OI): Lack of Ignorance**

* You know there is a door.
* You know where the door is.
* You can see the path to the door clearly.

# Leveraging Project Management Methodologies

Explore methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, and Agile on your own. For now, let's focus on an essential concept: **spikes**.

**Spikes** are short, time-boxed research tasks designed to answer specific questions or solve particular problems before starting the main project work.

---

# Benefits of Spikes

- **Clarify Requirements**: Quickly gather necessary information.
- **Solve Problems Early**: Address technical uncertainties before main development.
- **Prevent Delays**: Avoid excessive brainstorming that can stall progress.
- **Reduce Unknowns**: Lower the project's uncertainties.
- **Efficient Estimates**: Provide well-constrained estimates on specific work items.
- **Maximize Value**: A one-day spike giving 80% confidence can be more valuable than a three-day spike giving 90%.

<!-- Speaker notes: Instructor Phil noted that during Team Project 1, students often stalled for two days due to extensive brainstorming on data handling. We're discussing spikes today because they prevent such delays by providing a structured approach to gather information and clarify project scopes efficiently. It's about time-boxing the analysis and thinking time to maximize productivity. Spikes help reduce the unknowns in a project and provide well-constrained estimates on specific work items, ensuring efficient use of resources. The goal is to deliver the most value given certain resources, so a shorter spike that provides sufficient confidence can be more valuable than a longer one. -->

---

# Goals for Today

* Understand your objective and your data.

* Break down project into milestones and assign tasks.

* Identify spikes.

* Get started!
