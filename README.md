# Team Project

## Description

The purpose of the Team Project is to promote your ability to deliver business value in a real-world context. You should include this project in your portfolio, and be comfortable presenting it to potential employers as a demonstration of your skillset.

The Team Project consists of two modules, and each module requires participants to apply the skills they have learned to date. The first part of the Team Project involves exploring a dataset and creating a simple program to analyze it. In the second part of the Team Project, teams will come together again and apply the skills developed in each of the data science or machine learning foundations certificate streams. Teams will either create a data visualization or a machine learning model.

Participants will work in assigned teams of 4-5.

## Participant Expectations

* Participants are expected to attend live learning sessions and the case study as part of the learning experience. Participants are expected to use the rest of the scheduled work period time to complete their projects.
* Participants are encouraged to ask questions and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
* Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code. It should be used as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect participants to have completed the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/tree/main/onboarding_documents).
* We encourage participants to default to having their camera on at all times, and turning the camera off only as needed. This will greatly enhance the learning experience for all participants and provides real-time feedback for the instructional team.

### Delivery of Team Project Modules

Each Team Project module will include one or two live learning sessions and one case study presentation. During live learning sessions, facilitators will introduce the project, walk through relevant examples, and introduce various team skills that support project success. The remaining time will be used for teams to assemble and work on their projects, as well as get help from the facilitator or the learning support to troubleshoot any issues a team may be encountering. 

Work periods will also be used as opportunities for teams to collaborate and work together, while accessing learning support.
