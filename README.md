# Customer Personality Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Customer Personality Analysis Project!** This project uses a dataset of customer information to optimal customer clusters using robust clustering methods, and subsequently tailor marketing strategies for each cluster to drive higher revenue and customer engagement.
Using various machine learning techniques. Our team has analyzed, cleansed and manipulated the data by adding more information based the existing data like totals, Age, …etc., and done a dimensional reduction to prepare it for clustering using KMeans and elbow methods.
After that, profiling of clusters done by the team to better understand the clusters so that we can derive actionable recommendations for the marketing team.

## Project Question
- How can we identify optimal customer clusters using robust clustering methods, and subsequently tailor marketing strategies for each cluster to drive higher revenue and customer engagement?

## Objectives
*   Cluster Analysis:
    -   Determine the optimal number of customer groups.
    -   Analyze demographic and behavioral data to segment customers effectively.
*   Marketing Insights:
    -   Generate actionable recommendations for each identified customer group to improve campaign targeting and effectiveness.

## Dataset Details
*   Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis
* 	Description:
    -   Contains customer demographic attributes
    -   Contains customer behavioral attributes
    -   Used to explore patterns to optimize marketing strategies 
    -	Format: Tab-Separated Values (TSV)

## Assumptions
1.	Data Consistency:
    -   Assumed  “Graduation” equals “Bachelor” and “2n Cycle” equals “Master” 
    - 	Assumed  “Together” equals “Married” and “Alone” equals “Single” 
2.	Outlier Removal: 
    -   Income greater than 125K and ages over 100 years were treated as outliers.

## Data Cleansing  
1.  Dropping observations with meaningless values as: 
    -  'Absurd' and 'YOLO' values under marital status 
2.  Dropping columns with meaningless values as: 
    -   Z_CostContact   =3 always 
    -   Z_Revenue =11 always
  
###  Dataset Adaptation: 
*   Original TSV file renamed and reformatted for easier handing. 

## Tools and Frameworks
### Libraries:
* Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
* Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualizations.
* Scikit-learn for clustering
* KElbowVisualizer for determining optimal number of clusters

### **Part 2 of the Project: Segmenting Customers into groups**

<img src="reports/3D_Cluster_Visualization_of_PCA_Components.png" alt="Image" height="200" width="300" >

#### **Segmentation or clustering customers in groups:**  
Grouping customers based on similar traits and shared characteristics such as income, age, spending, …etc., and since we did not know what the best combinations are, we used unsupervised method to analyze the data and cluster customers in groups.

- **Objective:** To visualize the clusters or groups of the customer. The goal is to group customers with shared characteristics and traits.
- **Insights:** By analyzing the dominant features within each cluster and each feature contribution in each cluster, we gain insights into the key characteristics that define each group:
    -    Feature 1's top 3 influential variables are 'Income', 'NumCatalogPurchases', and 'MntMeatProducts'
    -    Feature 2's top 3 influential variables are 'Teenhome', 'NumDealsPurchases', and 'NumWebPurchases'
    -    Feature 3's top 3 influential variables are 'AcceptedCmp4', 'Response', 'AcceptedCmp2'

#### **Audience:**

- Marketing team and Data Scientists.
